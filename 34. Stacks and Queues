To solve this challenge, we must first take each character in s, enqueue it in a queue, and also push that same character onto a stack. 
Once that's done, we must dequeue the first character from the queue and pop the top character off the stack, 
then compare the two characters to see if they are the same; as long as the characters match, we continue dequeueing, popping, and 
comparing each character until our containers are empty (a non-match means s isn't a palindrome).

public class Solution {
    
Stack <Character> stack = new Stack<Character>();
Queue <Character> queue = new LinkedList<>();

    void pushCharacter(char ch) {
        stack.push(ch);
    }

    void enqueueCharacter(char ch) {
        queue.add(ch);
    }

    char popCharacter() {
        return stack.pop();
    }

    char dequeueCharacter() {
        return queue.remove();
    }

    // Write your code here.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scan.nextLine();
        scan.close();

        // Convert input String to an array of characters:
        char[] s = input.toCharArray();

        // Create a Solution object:
        Solution p = new Solution();

        // Enqueue/Push all chars to their respective data structures:
        for (char c : s) {
            p.pushCharacter(c);
            p.enqueueCharacter(c);
        }

        // Pop/Dequeue the chars at the head of both data structures and compare them:
        boolean isPalindrome = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length/2; i++) {
            if (p.popCharacter() != p.dequeueCharacter()) {
                isPalindrome = false;                
                break;
            }
        }

        //Finally, print whether string s is palindrome or not.
        System.out.println( "The word, " + input + ", is " 
                           + ( (!isPalindrome) ? "not a palindrome." : "a palindrome." ) );
    }
}
